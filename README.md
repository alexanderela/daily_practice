# Daily Practice Repo

## Summary
This repo consists of several practice applications used during my time at Turing that I will be reconstructing as practice during my time between leaving Turing and securing employment.

These applications focus on one or more of the following areas:

* React.js
* Redux
* Unit testing in Enzyme/Jest
* Debugging existing codebases
